- Organize the code as suggested by Joe in https://github.com/jcheng5/shiny-partials
- Move regular functions to separate files so they can be sourced from Rstudio and used 
in the creation of Rmarkdown documents (e.g., answer keys)
- How to best name the functions? Avoid putting in default terms?
- Logging data transformations. Do a check if the original data is equal to the final data after the listed set of transformations.
- Can choose the type of plot for single varible (e.g., box plot or time-series or histogram)
