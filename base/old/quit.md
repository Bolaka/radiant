> Manage the state (settings, analyses, plots, etc.) of the Radiant app

This page provides another option to save the current state of the app to disk. See the help file for the Data > Manage page for more details. To reset the app to a _clean_ initial state press the Reset button. Finally, to cleanly exit from Radiant and close the browser window, click the Quit button.
