## Radiant

Radiant is a platform-independent browser-based interface for business analytics in [R](http://www.r-project.org/), based on the [Shiny](http[://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) package.

## Key features

- Explore: Quickly and easily summarize, visualize, and analyze your data
- Interactive: Results update immediately when inputs are changed (i.e., no separate dialog boxes).
- Reproducible: Save and load the state of the application to continue your analysis at a later time or on another computer. Share the state-file with others or create a report using [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
- Cross-platform: It runs in a browser on Windows, Mac, and Linux. No data will leave your computer and you can run it without an internet connection. You can, however, also run it as a web application on a server.
- Context: Data and examples focus on business applications
- Programming: ...

Radiant also provides a bridge to programming in R(studio). For example, you can run your analyses in Radiant and output the relevant function calls to an [Rmarkdown document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (see `R > Report`). As an example, click the book icon on the bottom left on the `Base > Single mean` page) to start working on your report. Press `Update` to render the report to HTML. You can also call the analysis functions from your own R-code. For more information on programming with Radiant see the [programming](http://vnijs.github.io/radiant/programming.html) page.
