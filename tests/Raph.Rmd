Here is the mds paste:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
result <- mds("Car Survey MDS 2015", "ID.1", "ID.2", "Distance", NULL, "metric", "2", 1.3)
summary_mds(result)
plots_mds(result)
```
I think that is it for the code. For the FA, I am using

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
result <- pmap("Car Survey Factor Analysis 2015", "Brand", c("Sporty", "Youthful", "Safe", "Good.deal", "Appeals.to.women", "Fuel.Efficient", "Powerful", "Slow", "Expensive", "Appeals.to.Men"), NULL, "2", 2.1, 1.3, 0, c("brand", "attr"))
summary_pmap(result)
plots_pmap(result)
savePmapFactorScores(result)
```

# library(pryr)
# environmentName(environment())
# env.profile(environment())
# r_env
# object_size(r_env)
# r_env_copy <- r_env
# object_size(r_env_copy)
# object_size(r_env_copy, r_env)
# r_env$values
# rm(r_env_copy)
# r_env



1. Tomorrow (through Tuesday): Perceptual maps. (Some students will use this through the end of April). I will do both factor analysis and MDS.
2. Feb 12-17: Market segmentation (mostly kmeans). There will be some of this used afterwards, for an assignment due March 3, and for a final project due at the end of April.
3. April 2 – Hypothesis testing. This will probably be done in class. I will use the Single Mean and Compare Means test. It would be helpful to add a “paired means” test, if possible.
4. March 26 & March 31: If you are able to add logistic regression, I would use that in class on those dates. If not, no worries.
