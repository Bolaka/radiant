## How to install Radiant

Radiant is a platform-independent browser-based interface for business analytics in [R](http://www.r-project.org/), based on the [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) package. Developed by <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/nijs/" target="\_blank">Vincent Nijs</a>. Please use the issue tracker on GitHub to suggest enhancements or report problems: https://github.com/vnijs/radiant/issues. For other questions and comments please use radiant@rady.ucsd.edu.

#### 1. Install R for your system

For mac go to <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/" target="_blank">https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/</a>

For windows you can get the latest release here: <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/release.htm" target="_blank">https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/release.htm</a>

#### 2. Install Rstudio

Get that latest release of Rstudio for your system from:

<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="_blank">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a>

#### 3. Use a modern browser 

For example, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/) or Safari. Internet Explorer (version 11 or higher) should work as well 

#### 4. Install Radiant

To install Radiant open R(studio) and copy-and-paste the command below and press return:

```r
install.packages("radiant", repos = "http://vnijs.github.io/radiant_miniCRAN/")
```

If you are asked where to install Radiant and its dependencies answer "yes" or "y" “Would you like to use a personal library instead?”

#### 5. Create a desktop launcher

Please create a Radiant-launcher on your Desktop that will start and update Radiant for you. Copy-and-paste (or type) the command below into Rstudio:

```r
radiant::launcher()
```

and press return. When asked if you want to create a short-cut type `y`. A file called `radiant.bat` (windows) or `radiant.command` (mac) will be created that you can double-click to start Radiant in your default browser. The `launcher` command will also create a file called `update_radiant.bat` (windows) or `update_radiant.command` (mac) that you can double-click to update Radiant to the latest release. Alternatively, you can start Radiant from Rstudio using the commands below:

```r
library(radiant)
radiant()
```

When Radiant starts you will see data on diamond prices. To close the application click the <i title='Power off' class='fa fa-power-off'></i> icon in the navigation bar and then click `Stop`. The Radiant process will stop and the browser window will close (Chrome) or gray-out.

If you get stuck, take a look at the `Installing Radiant` video:
