Hi folks,

I am sharing a (read-only) dropbox folder with you that contains an application called Radiant that both Terry and I will use for class this fall.

If you do not yet have a dropbox account please sign-up at https://www.dropbox.com/. You will also need the Dropbox destktop application. If you see the Dropbox icon on your screen you already have it. If not, download the software from https://www.dropbox.com/install and install it. Login to dropbox as normal and accept the invitation in this email to share the radiant folder (see blue button below). Wait until radiant has synced to your computer and then download and install R (version 3.1.1). Links to the required version of R are in Dropbox/radiant/launchers/Installing-R.html

For Windows: http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/windows/base/R-3.1.1-win.exe
For Mac (10.9 aka Mavericks): http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/macosx/R-3.1.1-mavericks.pkg
R-3.1.1 for Mac (10.6 - 10.8): http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/macosx/R-3.1.1-snowleopard.pkg

To start the app use the launcher in the directory Dropbox/radiant/launchers/quant. For Windows use the .bat file and for Mac the .app file. For example, to start the app on Windows, double-click the quant/radiant_win_quant.bat file. When the app starts for the first time a number of required packages will be installed, and this may take a few minutes.


When you start the app on a mac, you may see a pop-up that says "The actions 'Watch Me Do' encountered an error". This just means that you need to give the launcher permission to run. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy and select the Privacy tab. Click the checkbox next to the launchers file you tried to run and the message will no longer be shown when you run the app again.

I suggest you install Chrome or Firefox for better performance. Safari is also fine. IE has security problems (Terryâ€™s two cents).

Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/
Firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/

Thanks!

Vincent & Terry
