## Radiant: Business analytics using R and Shiny

Interactive business analytics using [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [Shiny](http[://www.rstudio.com/shiny/). Radiant is designed to facilitate decision making in business using data and models. It is currently used in the Research for Marketing Decisions and Quantitative Analysis classes at the <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/" target="\_blank">Rady School of Management</a> by <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/nijs/" target="\_blank">Vincent Nijs</a> and <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/august/">Terrence August</a>. Developed by <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/nijs/" target="\_blank">Vincent Nijs</a>. For questions and comments please use radiant@rady.ucsd.edu.

## Key features

- Explore: Quickly and easily summarize and visualize your data
- Interactive: Results update immediately when inputs are changed (i.e., no separate dialog boxes)
- Context: Data and examples focus on business applications
- Save and share your work: Load and save the state of the application to continue your analysis at a later time or on another computer. Share the state-file with others or create a (reproducible) report using [Rmarkdown document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). You will not lose your work if you accidentally leave the radiant page in your browser
- Cross-platform: It runs in a browser

## Goal

Provide access the power of R for business analytics. Radiant also provides a bridge to programming in R(studio). For example, you can run your analyses in Radiant and output the relevant function calls to an [Rmarkdown document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (see `R > Report`). Reproducible research, with no programming required. Most pages have an icon you can click (e.g., the book icon on the bottom left on the `Base > Single mean` page) to start working on your report. Press `Update` to render the report to HTML.

In the near future it will be possible to use Rstudio to render and edit rmarkdown documents created in Radiant. When you install and load Radiant it exports functions that can be called from R-code and/or an rmarkdown document (_work in progress_).

If you close Radiant using `Quit > Quit` after launching it from Rstudio or Rgui you can can paste the commands below into the command console to get the same output as in the browser.

```r
result <- single_mean("diamonds","price")
summary(result)
plot(result)
```

You can call functions for visualization and analysis in your R-code and access basic help from the console using:

```r
?single_mean
```

As an example, you can compile the [`single_mean.Rmd`](https://github.com/mostly-harmless/radiant/blob/master/examples/single_mean.Rmd?raw=true) file into html (or pdf or word if you prefer) in Rstudio. Note that this feature is currently available for the `single_mean`, `single_prop`, and `compare_means` functions.

## Saving and loading state

To save the your analyses you can save the state of the app (Data > Manage). You can open the state file at a later time to continue where you left off. As a simple example, go to the Data > View and Data > Visualize tabs to see what they look like by default. Then load the state_file [`RadiantState.rda`](https://github.com/mostly-harmless/radiant/blob/master/examples/RadiantState.rda?raw=true) in the `examples` folder and go back the View and Visualize tabs.

A related feature in Radiant is that state is maintained if you accidentally navigate to another page, close (and reopen) the browser, and/or hit refresh. Use Quit > Reset to return to a clean/new state.

Loading and saving state now also works with Rstudio. If you start Radiant from Rstudio and use Quit > Quit to stop the app, lists called `r_data` and `r_state` will be put into Rstudio's global workspace. If you start radiant again using `radiant()` it will use these lists (i.e., `r_data` and `r_state`) to restore state. This can be convenient if you want to make changes to a data file in Rstudio and load it back into Radiant. Also, if you load a state file in Rstudio it will be used when you start Radiant to recreate a previous state.

**Technical note**: The way loading state works in the app is as follows: When an input is initialized in a Shiny app you set a default value in the call to, for example, numericInput. In Radiant, when a state file has been loaded and an input is initialized it looks to see if there is a value for an input of that name in a list called `r_state`. If there is, this value is used. The `r_state` is created when saving state using `reactiveValuesToList(input)`. An example of a call to numericInput is given below where the `state_init` function from `radiant.R` is used to check if a value from `r_state` can be used. `sm_args$sm_comp_value` is the default value specified in the `single_mean` function call.

```r
numericInput("sm_comp_value", "Comparison value:", state_init('sm_comp_value',sm_args$sm_comp_value))
```

## Source code

Three (related) apps are included in the inst directory. `Base`, offers data loading, saving, viewing, visualizing, merging, and transforming tools. The `quant` app sources the code from base and extends it. Finally, the `marketing` app sources the code from `base` and `quant` and extends it with additional tools.

### How-to install Radiant

- Required: [R](https://github.com/mostly-harmless/radiant_miniCRAN/tree/gh-pages/R-3.1.2), version 3.1.2
- Required: A modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, or Firefox)
- Recommended: [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

You can install the `Radiant` package and all package dependencies from the [radiant_miniCRAN](https://github.com/mostly-harmless/radiant_miniCRAN) repo (created using [miniCRAN](https://github.com/andrie/miniCRAN)). Open R(studio) and copy-and-paste the commands below.
